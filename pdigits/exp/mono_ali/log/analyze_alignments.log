The optional-silence phone sil occupies 52.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 63.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 25.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.6 hours of data, or 0.3 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 15.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (25,25.4,45)

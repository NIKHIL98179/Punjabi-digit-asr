This project includes a small automatic speech recognition system for digit sequence spoken in punjabi language.
<br>
This project was implemented using Kaldi toolkit(an open source toolkit for automatic speech recognition). 
<br>
I've taken reference from this project --> https://github.com/KunalDhawan/ASR-System-for-Hindi-Language. 
<br>
This project contains the code for following system :- 
<br>
<b>a) Monophone-HMM System <br>
b) Triphone-HMM System <br>
c) SGMM-HMM System , <br></b>
all of which are built using Kaldi toolkit. For Kaldi toolkit info -> http://kaldi-asr.org/

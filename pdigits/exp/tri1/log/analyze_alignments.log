The optional-silence phone sil occupies 52.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 63.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 25.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.6 hours of data, or 0.3 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 16.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (25,25.1,45)

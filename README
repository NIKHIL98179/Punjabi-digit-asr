This project includes a small automatic speech recognition system for digit sequence spoken in punjabi language.
This project was implemented using Kaldi toolkit(an open source toolkit for automatic speech recognition). 
I've taken reference from this project --> https://github.com/KunalDhawan/ASR-System-for-Hindi-Language. 
This project contains the code for following system :- 
a) Monophone-HMM System 
b) Triphone-HMM System 
c) SGMM-HMM System , 
all of which are built using Kaldi toolkit. For Kaldi toolkit info -> http://kaldi-asr.org/

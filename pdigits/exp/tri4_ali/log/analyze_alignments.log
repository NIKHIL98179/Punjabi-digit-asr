The optional-silence phone sil occupies 51.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 63.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 23.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.6 hours of data, or 0.3 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 16.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (23,23.2,44)
